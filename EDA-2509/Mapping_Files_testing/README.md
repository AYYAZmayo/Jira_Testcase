# BRAM Mapping Files Simulation

In this simulation setup, memory initialization is tested through comparison between original model and BRAM mapping files.

To run simulation for TDP_RAM36K, run this command:

```
make tdp36
```

To run simulation for TDP_RAM18KX2, run this command:

```
make tdp18
```

To remove output files, run this command:

```
make clean
```
